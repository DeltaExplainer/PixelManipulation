Pixel Manipulation of Images using Web Programming

Digital images are composed of pixels with three basic color components: red, green, and blue,
aka, RGB color model. They can be manipulated or edited by directly changing the RGB values
of the pixels within the images. Photoshop is a good example of image editing software. Our
work is to demonstrate several image manipulation techniques through web
programming and to display resultant images on web browsers. The manipulations include
inverting images (film negatives), converting into gray-scale from colored images, making
images fuzzier, adding artificial vignette to images (fading into darker edges), adding
annotations to images (such as bars and shapes), and hiding secret text messages into images
(steganography).Â 
Amongst these, steganography is a unique way of image processing where secret data are
embedded into digital carriers such as images such that it cannot be easily detected by human
visual system. In this technique, we modify the pixels for hiding secret information by utilizing
large amount of redundant bits.
